# superfund-PCA-DA-classification

The report carries out principal component analysis (PCA) variables between age and labor
force predictors. These PCA variables were then applied to discriminant analysis (DA) models
to determine the classification strength in distinguishing social classes within a Superfund and
non-Superfund tracts.
